Crafting:

output="cars:car 1",
recipe={

=====================
Use:

Punch anything with a "Car" to turn into a car. You will only be able to see it from third-person view (press F7).
This has the following effects:

* Makes you appear to be a car
* Makes you faster (if anticheat is off), unable to jump, and heavier

Note that it does *not* change your collision box or anything related to that, in an attempt to maintain compatibility with narrow roads.

Once you are a car, you can punch anything with a "car" (again) to restore everything to normal.
